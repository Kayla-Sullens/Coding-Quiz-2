# Coding Quiz

## Description

This challenge assignment had a heavy focus on JaveScript and the DOM as we focused on Web APIs in this module. I decided to take a different approach with this one, and instead of displaying correct/incorrect when an answer was selected I had the color change to green or red. Since I have a background in education and could see myself creating educational quizzes and other content, I wanted to explore some other ways of giving a quiz.
